# Intro to ReactJS

**Definition/Overview:** ReactJS is a client-side JavaScript (JS) library that is utilized by developers to build and customize interactive user interfaces (UIs) via highly reusable and flexible web components. The relatively light learning curve (in comparison to a heavier JS framework, such as AngularJS) of ReactJS assists in optimizing UIs and their associated User Experience (UX) potential.

**How is ReactJS Optimized?:** Some of the ReactJS features that benefit UI/UX developers include...
  
* Debouncing and Throttling
  + This limits when functions execute, and how often.
* Lazy Loading
  + This limits component loading to only when it is needed.
* List Virtualization
  + This limits the rendering of list items to only when they are available on screen to users.
* Memoization
  + This caches responses for future re-use, increasing performance when serving clients web assets.
* useTransition() Hook Utilization
  + This limits updates until when they are needed, potentially increasing performance.
